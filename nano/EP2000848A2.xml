<Abstract>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor optoelectronic waveguide having an nin-type hetero structure which is able to stably operate an optical modulator. On the upper and lower surfaces of the core layer (11) determined for the structure so that electro-optical effects are effectively exerted at an operating light wavelength and at the same time light absorption poses no problem are provided with intermediate clad layers (12-1, 12-2) having a band gap which is greater than that of the core layer (11) in order to prevent carriers generated by light absorption from being trapped by the hetero interface. Respectively on the upper surface of the intermediate clad layer (12-1) and the lower surface of the intermediate clad layer (12-2) are provided the clad layers (13-1, 13-2) having the band gap which is greater than those of the intermediate clad layers.;  On the upper surface of the clad layer (13-1) are sequentially laminated a p-type layer (15) and an n-type layer (16). In the applied voltage range used under an operating state, a whole region of the p-type layer (15) and a part or a whole region of the n-type layer (16) are depleted.
