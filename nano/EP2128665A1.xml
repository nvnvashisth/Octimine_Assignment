<Abstract>
An optical filter includes a light-shielding conductive layer provided with a plurality of apertures on a substrate surface that selectively transmits light of a first wavelength, and a dielectric layer in contact with the conductive layer. A size of the apertures is a size equal to or less than the first wavelength, and a ratio of a surface area of the conductive layer to a surface area of the substrate surface is within a range of equal to or greater than 36% and equal to or less than 74%. A transmissivity of the first wavelength is increased by surface plasmons induced in the apertures by light falling on the conductive layer.
