<Abstract>
Nanostructures and quantum dots are used in photovoltaic cells or solar cells outside of the active layer to improve efficiency and other solar cell properties. In particular, organic photovoltaic cells can benefit. The quantum dot can absorb light which is not absorbed by the active layer and emit red-shifted light which is absorbed by the active layer. The active layer, the hole transport layer, or the hole injection layer can comprise regioregular polythiophenes. Quantum dots can form a quantum dot layer, and the quantum dot layer can be found between the light source and the active layer or on the side of the active layer opposite the light source. Quantum dots can also be used in electrode layers.
