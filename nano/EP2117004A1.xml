<Abstract>
An information recording/reproducing device is provided with a recording medium (120) with a recording surface, a plurality of probes (135) that carry out at least either record processing or reproduction processing by scanning a plurality of information tracks (210) on the recording surface, a position detecting means that detects a position of at least one information track by using the probe for every plural divided regions into which the recording medium is divided in a direction intersecting the plural information tracks and which contain at least one information track, and a track control means that controls tracking of the probe used for at least either record processing or reproduction processing for every plural divided regions. Thus, the device structure can be simplified.
