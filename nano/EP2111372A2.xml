<Abstract>
The disclosure relates to a process for making a surface treated suspension of finely divided titanium (IV) oxide particles, typically, finely divided titanium (IV) oxide nanoparticles, comprising: vigorously mixing (a) a volume of a first component comprising a major proportion of alcohol, a minor proportion of titanium alkoxide and a minor proportion of a titanium alkoxide activator selected from the group consisting of water and a first aqueous base, and (b) a volume of a second component selected from the group consisting of water and a second aqueous base, at least one of the first component or the second component having a base therein, the second component being substantially free of alcohol, to form a mixture comprising a suspension of finely divided titanium (IV) oxide particle, the mixture having a water to titanium molar ratio ranging from about 40 to about 1 to about 5000 to about 1, wherein the proportion of the titanium alkoxide, the proportion of the activator, the mixing vigor, and the ratio of the volume of the first component to the volume of the second component are effective for the suspension of the finely divided particles to form in the mixture;  and treating the suspension with a compound comprising a source of silicon, aluminum or zinc, and products made by the foregoing process. The suspension can be dried to recover a powder.
