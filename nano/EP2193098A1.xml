<Abstract>
Provided are three-dimensional (3D) nanodevices including 3D nanostructures. The 3D nanodevice includes at least one nanostructure, each nanostructure including an oscillation portion floating over a substrate and support portions for supporting both lengthwise end portions of the oscillation portion, supports disposed on the substrate to support the support portions of each of the nanostructures, at least one controller disposed at an upper portion of the substrate, a lower portion of the substrate, or both the upper and lower portions of the substrate to control each of the nanostructures, and a sensing unit disposed on each of the oscillation portions to sense an externally supplied adsorption material. Thus, unlike in a typical planar device, generation of impurities between a nanodevice and a substrate can be reduced, and mechanical vibration can be caused. In particular, since 3D nanostructures have mechanical and electrical characteristics, 3D nanodevices including new 3D nanostructures can be provided using nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS). Also, a single electron device, a spin device, or a single electron transistor (SET)-field effect transistor (FET) hybrid device can be formed using a simple process unlike in planar devices.
