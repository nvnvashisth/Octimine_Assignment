<Abstract>
The disclosed is a synthetic fiber which comprises an organic polymer and carbon fibrous structures, wherein the content of the carbon fibrous structure is 0.01 - 30 % by weight based on the total weight of the synthetic fiber, wherein the carbon fibrous structure comprises a three dimensional network of carbon fibers each having an outside diameter of 15 - 100 nm, wherein the carbon fibrous structure further comprises a granular part with which the carbon fibers are tied together in the state that the concerned carbon fibers are externally elongated therefrom, and wherein the granular part is produced in a growth process of the carbon fibers. The new synthetic fiber which possesses high electrical conductivity and high strength as distinct from those of the conventional synthetic fiber is provided.
