<Abstract>
Provided is nanosemiconductor particles wherein the particle diameter distribution of a core section and the particle diameter distribution of shelled particles have a core-shell structure wherein the optical characteristics of nanoparticles, i.e., an optical element, are optimized. The nanosemiconductor particles have the core-shell structure composed of the core section and a shell section. The average particle diameter of the shelled particle is 100nm or less, and the variation coefficient of the particle diameter of the core section is within 30%.
