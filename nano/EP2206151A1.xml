<Abstract>
A method for integrating Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) circuitry with logic circuitry is provided. The method includes depositing a first layer of gate material over the NVM area and the logic area of the substrate. The method further includes depositing multiple adjoining sacrificial layers comprising nitride, oxide and nitride (ARC layer) overlying each other. The multiple adjoining sacrificial layers are used to pattern select gate and control gate of memory transistor in the NVM area, and the ARC layer of the multiple adjoining sacrificial layers is used to pattern gate of logic transistor in the logic area.
