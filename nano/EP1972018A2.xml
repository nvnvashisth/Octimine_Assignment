<Abstract>
Amorphous or partially amorphous nanoscale ion storage materials are provided. For example, lithium transition metal phosphate storage compounds are nanoscale and amorphous or partially amorphous in an as-prepared state, or become amorphous or partially amorphous upon electrochemical intercalation or de- intercalation by lithium. These nanoscale ion storage materials are useful for producing devices such as high energy and high power storage batteries.
