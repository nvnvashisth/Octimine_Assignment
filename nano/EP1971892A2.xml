<Abstract>
A signal isolator for providing at an output thereof representations of input currents from a source provided in an input conductor supported on a substrate having a bridge circuit suited for electrical connection to a source of electrical energization with a pair of series circuit members electrically connected in parallel with one another supported on a substrate with each series circuit member having a magnetoresistive member electrically connected in series with a current value controller, controlled at a controller terminal, at an output terminal of that controller. Each magnetoresistive members is electrically isolated from the input conductor and has a resistance versus applied external magnetic field characteristic that is substantially linear for at least relatively small externally applied magnetic fields.;  The signal isolator further has a differential input amplifier connected at its inputs to both the magnetoresistive member and the current value controller in a corresponding one of the bridge circuit series circuit members, and has outputs connected to the controller control terminals which can be made through a lowpass filter. A signal monitor arrangement can be provided to have a constant representation value on the isolator output if magnetoresistive members cease to be in those magnetic fields arising from the input currents for a selected time duration.
