<Abstract>
A pattern forming method for forming a pattern includes: preparing a mold 104 provided with a first surface including a pattern area 1000, a second surface located opposite from the first surface, and an alignment mark 2070 provided at a position at which the alignment mark 2070 is away from the second surface and is close to the first surface;  contacting the pattern area 1000 of the mold 104 with the coating material disposed on a substrate 5000;  obtaining information about positions of the mold 104 and the substrate 5000 by using the alignment mark 2070 and a mark 5300 provided to the substrate 5000 in a state in which the coating material is disposed on the substrate 5000 at a portion where the alignment mark 2070 and the substrate 5000 are opposite to each other;  and effecting alignment of the substrate 5000 with the mold 104 with high accuracy on the basis of the information.

<Claims>
<P>
1. A pattern forming method for forming an imprinted pattern on a coating material disposed on a substrate with a pattern provided to a mold, comprising:
</P>
<P>
preparing a mold provided with a first surface including a pattern area, a second surface located opposite from the first surface, and an alignment mark provided at a position at which the alignment mark is away from the first surface;
</P>
<P>
contacting the pattern area of the mold with the coating material disposed on the substrate;
</P>
<P>
obtaining information about positions of the mold and the substrate by using the alignment mark and a mark provided to the substrate in a state in which the coating material is disposed on the substrate at a portion where the alignment mark and the substrate are opposite to each other; and
</P>
<P>
effecting alignment of the substrate with the mold in an in-plane direction of the pattern area on the basis of the information in a state in which the pattern area and the coating material contact each other,wherein the coating material is cured while effecting the alignment.
</P>
<P>
2. A method according to Claim 1, wherein the coating material is a photocurable resin, a thermosetting resin, or a thermoplastic resin.
</P>
