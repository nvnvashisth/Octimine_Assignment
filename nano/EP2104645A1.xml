<Abstract>
Provided are processes for the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite. In these processes, ilmenite is digested with aqueous ammonium hydrogen oxalate. Iron from the ilmenite precipitates as a hydrated iron oxalate and is removed by filtering, leaving a titanium-rich solution. The titanium-rich solution can be further processed to form titanium dioxide.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
