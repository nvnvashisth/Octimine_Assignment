<Abstract>
A method of depositing elongated nanostructures that allows accurate positioning and orientation is described. The method involves printing or otherwise depositing elongated nanostructures in a carrier solution. The deposited droplets are also elongated, usually by patterning the surface upon which the droplets are deposited. As the droplet evaporates, the fluid flow within the droplets is controlled such that the nanostructures are deposited either at the edge of the elongated droplet or the center of the elongated droplet. The described deposition technique has particular application in forming the active region of a transistor.
