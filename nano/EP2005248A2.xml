<Abstract>
The present invention provides compositions and methods that may be used to form low thermal distortion molds. The composition may include a curable elastomeric silicone composition formed using a de-volatilized polymer and at least one de-volatilized cross-linker. One embodiment of the method may include forming a pattern on a first side of an elastomer that is impregnated with a fibrous material proximate a second side of the elastomer.
