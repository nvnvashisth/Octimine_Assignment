<Abstract>
In order to provide a photovoltaic device with high photoelectric conversion efficiency, an electron donating organic material for photovoltaic devices containing a conjugated polymer represented by formula (1) is invented: (wherein R 1 to R 10 may be the same or different from each other and are each selected from among hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group and an aryl group;  R 11 and R 12 may be the same or different from each other and are each selected from among hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heteroaryl group and halogen;  W, X, Y and Z may be the same or different from each other and are each selected from among a single bond, an arylene group, a heteroarylene group, an ethenylene group, and an ethynylene group;  m is 0 or 1;  n is within a range of 1 to 1000.)
