<Abstract>
A method of preparing an ultra sharp tip, in particular a single atom tip, is provided, comprising providing a tip (11) having a shank (15), an apex (16), and a coating (14,17,18) covering the shank and the apex;  locally removing the coating (14) from the apex (16) by field evaporation;  and partially or fully restoring the coating at the apex (16).
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
1. A method of preparing an ultra sharp tip, in particular a single atom tip, comprising:
</P>
<P>
providing a tip (11) having a shank (15), an apex (16), and a coating (14) covering the shank and the apex;
</P>
<P>
locally removing the coating (14) from the apex (16) by field evaporation; and
</P>
<P>
partially or fully restoring the coating at the apex (16).
</P>
<P>
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of partially or fully restoring is performed by annealing the tip, optionally such that at least a monolayer of the coating is formed on the apex.
</P>
<P>
3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein at least the steps of locally removing and partially or fully restoring are performed in a vacuum chamber (1; 10), optionally in situ.
</P>
<P>
4. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein in the step of locally removing the coating, the apex (16) is shaped by at least one step selected from the group consisting of thermally induced shaping, flattening by field evaporation, and sharpening by spatially controlled field-assisted etching.
</P>
<P>
5. The method according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising at least one step selected from the group consisting of partially removing atoms at the uppermost apex by field evaporation, and forming a protective coating on the tip and subsequently partially removing the protective coating at the uppermost apex by field evaporation.
</P>
<P>
6. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the step of providing comprises depositing the coating on the tip by at least one procedure selected from the group consisting of physical vapor deposition, electrolytic deposition, electroplating, and chemical vapor deposition.
</P>
<P>
7. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the step of providing comprises depositing the coating on the tip in a deposition device and mounting the coated tip in a vacuum chamber for preparing an ultra sharp tip.
</P>
<P>
8. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein at least the steps of locally removing and partially or fully restoring are performed while the tip is provided in a charged particle column, the tip being provided in a position to perform probing and/or structuring of a specimen, and/or wherein the ultra sharp tip is for an electron or ion source and at least the steps of locally removing and partially or fully restoring are performed while the tip is provided in the electron or ion source.
</P>
<P>
9. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the step of partially or fully restoring may be performed by at least one step selected from the group consisting of heating by applying a current to the tip, heating by laser irradiation, and deposition of additional coating material.
</P>
<P>
10. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the tip is at least one element selected from the group consisting of a single crystal tip; a metal tip, the coating being a noble metal coating; a metal tip comprising at least one refractory metal selected from the group consisting of W, Ta, Mo, Nb, Re, the coating comprising at least one noble metal selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Au, Ir, Cu, Ag.
</P>
<P>
11. An apparatus for preparing an ultra sharp tip, in particular a single atom tip, comprising
</P>
<P>
a vacuum chamber (1; 10) comprising
</P>
<P>
a tip support (3; 30);
</P>
<P>
a field evaporation device (2) adapted for performing a field evaporation at a tip (11; 50) provided at the tip support (3; 30); and
</P>
<P>
a coating restoring device (8).
</P>
<P>
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the coating restoring device (8) comprises at least one element selected from the group of a resistance heating device adapted for applying a current to the tip, a laser adapted for heating the tip, and a coating device adapted for coating the tip.
</P>
<P>
13. The apparatus of claim 11 or 12, wherein the tip support (3; 30) is a tip support of an electron or ion source.
</P>
<P>
14. The apparatus of any of claims 11 to 13, wherein the vacuum chamber (1; 10) comprises at least one element selected from the group consisting of a gas field ion source, an ion beam pattern generator, an electron source, field ion microscope, an electron microscope, and a coating device.
</P>
<P>
15. Use of an apparatus according to claims 11 to 14 in a method for preparing an ultra sharp tip, in particular a single atom tip.
