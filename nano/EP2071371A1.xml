<Abstract>
A three-dimensional photonic crystal is composed of columnar structures (150). The columnar structures of each layer include a flat bottom surface as one delimitting surface in a stacking plane, and a first structural portion, a second structural portion, and a third structural portion that are periodically arranged in a longitudinal direction of the columnar structures, the second structural portion having a second width (W2) larger than a first width (W1) of the first structural portion and a second height (H2) larger than a first height (H1) of the first structural portion, and the third structural portion arranged between the first and the second structural portions having a width and a height that continuously or stepwise change.;  The three-dimensional photonic crystal is characterized in that the flat bottom surface of the first structural portion of one of two adjacent layers contacts an upper surface opposite to the flat bottom surface of the second structural portion of the other layer.
