<Abstract>
A class of metamaterials and/or resonant materials and the method of their production, whereby nanoparticles (11) are segregated in the regions of topological defects (13), which are formed by inclusion of colloidal particles (12) in a layer of a nematic liquid crystal (14). The nanoparticles (11) are localized in the vicinity of topological defects (13), which can themselves be localized or delocalized, whereas the size of the nanoparticles (11) is smaller than the size of the colloidal particles (12), preferably of the size of the diameter of the defect (13).
