<Abstract>
Above the sample (9) having magnetic domains, a distribution of magnetic force in a measurement plane (91) is obtained as a magnetic force image with use of a MFM, an auxiliary magnetic force image is obtained by performing measurement in a measurement plane (92) away from the measurement plane (91) by a minute distance d, and a difference between them is divided by the minute distance d to obtain a magnetic force gradient image. The magnetic force image and the auxiliary magnetic force image are Fourier transformed and substituted into a three-dimensional field obtaining equation derived from a general solution of the Laplace equation, and the three-dimensional field indicating the magnetic force is obtained with high accuracy. A state of the magnetic domains at the surface (93) of the sample (9) can be obtained with high accuracy by obtaining the three-dimensional field.;  The three-dimensional field obtaining method using the three-dimensional field obtaining equation can be used for various fields of magnetic, electric, temperature and gravity potential and so on satisfying the Laplace equation. The obtaining of the three-dimensional field can be extended to obtaining of an n-dimensional field having high-dimension.
