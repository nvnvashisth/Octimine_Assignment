<Abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to mixed-scale electronic interfaces, included in integrated circuits and other electronic devices, that provide for dense electrical interconnection between microscale features of a predominantly microscale or submicroscale layer and nanoscale features of a predominantly nanoscale layer. The predominantly nanoscale layer, in one embodiment of the present invention, comprises a tessellated pattern of submicroscale or microscale pads densely interconnected by nanowire junctions between sets of parallel, closely spaced nanowire bundles. The predominantly submicroscale or microscale layer includes pins positioned complementarily to the submicroscale or microscale pads in the predominantly nanoscale layer.
