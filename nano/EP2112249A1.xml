<Abstract>
A heat-conducting medium (40) for placement between a heat source (46) and heat sink (47) to facilitate transfer of heat from the source to the sink is provided.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
1. A heat-conducting medium for thermal management, the medium comprising:
</P>
<P>
a flexible member made from an array of interweaving carbon nanotubes, the member having:
</P>
<P>
an upper surface against which a heat source may be placed;
</P>
<P>
an opposing lower surface; and
</P>
<P>
edges about the member designed for coupling to a heat sink toward which heat from the heat source can be directed;
</P>
<P>
a pad for placement on the upper surface to provide structural support to the member; and
</P>
<P>
a heat spreader positioned adjacent the heat source and upper surface of the member to facilitate radial transfer of heat from the heat source to a wider area on the flexible member.
</P>
<P>
2. A medium as set forth in claim 1, wherein the flexible member includes a polymeric material dispersed therethroughout.
</P>
<P>
3. A medium as set forth in claim 1, wherein the polymeric material includes one of polyamide, epoxy or a combination thereof.
</P>
<P>
4. A medium as set forth in claim 1, wherein the pad further provides support for the heat source when the heat source is positioned on the flexible member.
</P>
<P>
5. A medium as set forth in claim 1, further including a second pad for placement against the lower surface of the member to provide additional structural support to the member.
</P>
<P>
6. A medium as set forth in claim 1, wherein the heat spreader is positioned between the heat source and the upper surface of the member.
</P>
<P>
7. A medium as set forth in claim 1, further including a second heat spreader positioned against the lower surface of the member to enhance spreading of heat from the heat source radially along the textile material.
</P>
<P>
8. A medium as set forth in claim 7, wherein the second heat spreader is positioned against the lower surface directly below the heat spreader on the upper surface of the member.
</P>
