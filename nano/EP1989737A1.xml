<Abstract>
A multifunctional, programmable quantum confinement switching device uses the quantum confinement of charge carriers to operate on an input signal or energy and to release an output signal or energy. Energy enters the device through an input path and leaves through an output path, after being selectively blocked or modified by the switching action of the device under the influence of a control path. The quantum confinement of charge carriers as an artificial atom within a layer of the device in a quantum well or a quantum dot operates as the switch. The artificial atoms serve as dopants within a material supporting the device and are directly related to the voltage between the control path and a ground plane. The electrical, optical, thermal, or other energy passing through the device is selectively blocked, regulated, filtered, or modified by the doping properties of the artificial atoms. The remaining, unblocked energy is then free to exit the device through the output path.
