<Abstract>
A resistance value R of each of first magnetoresistance effect elements 10 and 11 changes in response to a magnetic field strength change in a positive direction of an external magnetic field H1 while second magnetoresistance effect elements 12 and 13 maintain a constant voltage value. A resistance value R of each of the second magnetoresistance effect elements 12 and 13 changes in response to a magnetic field strength change in a negative direction of an external magnetic field H2 while the first magnetoresistance effect elements 10 and 11 maintain a constant voltage value. In this way, a magnetic sensor stably operates in a bipolar fashion regardless of the polarity of the external magnetic field.
