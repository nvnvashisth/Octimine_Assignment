<Abstract>
A compound screening apparatus (160) divides measurement data representing the amount of binding between one kind of protein and each of a plurality of kinds of compounds, obtained by a measurement apparatus (110), into groups, each including data obtained in a same measurement condition. The compound screening apparatus (160) obtains a representative value of measurement data that is obtained when the protein and a compound are not bound to each other for each of the groups by using the measurement data of the respective groups, and sets a threshold value for extracting a hit compound for each of the groups by using corrected measurement data, obtained by correcting the measurement data for each of the groups so that the representative value obtained for each of the groups becomes the same value. Then, a hit compound is extracted by comparing the threshold value with the corrected measurement data.
