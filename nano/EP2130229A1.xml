<Abstract>
The present invention relates to a nanostructured device for charge storage. In particular the invention relates to a charge storage device that can be used for memory applications. According to the invention the device comprise a first nanowire with a first wrap gate arranged around a portion of its length, and a charge storing terminal connected to one end, and a second nanowire with a second wrap gate arranged around a portion of its length. The charge storing terminal is connected to the second wrap gate, whereby a charge stored on the charge storing terminal can affect a current in the second nanowire. The current can be related to written (charged) or unwritten (no charge) state, and hence a memory function is established.
