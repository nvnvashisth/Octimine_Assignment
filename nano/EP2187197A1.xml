<Abstract>
A controller (21) of a cantilever evaluation system (20) calculates a stream function value Èx(x, y;  t + 1) and vorticity Éz(x, y;  t + 1) at a subsequent time step t + 1 using boundary conditions according to displacement h(z;  t) of a cantilever (C) and velocity h/ t(z;  t), a stream function value Èz(x, y;  t) and vorticity Éz(x, y;  t) in two-dimensional planes (S2-3). The controller (21) uses the calculated stream function value Èz(x, y) and vorticity Éz(x, y) to calculate a fluid drag force (Fliq) acting on the cantilever (C) (S2-6). The controller (21) substitutes the calculated fluid drag force (Fliq) into a displacement calculation equation (6) to calculate the displacement h(z;  t + 1) of the one-dimensional beam at the subsequent time step t + 1 (S3-2). The controller (21) repeats such calculation for each grid point and further repeats it at each time step.
