<Abstract>
The present invention provides nanocomposite and hybride materials both comprising functionalized carbon nanotubes (202-205) and cellulose (201) or functionalized cellulose as well as methods of fabricating these materials. The hybride material also comprises a cross-linking reagent to cross-link the nanotubes and cellulose. In addition, polymer materials and an aerogel all containing the nanocomposite or the hybride material are disclosed. The described nanocomposites are strong and electrically conducting, and have many materials and electronic applications, such as supercapacitors.
