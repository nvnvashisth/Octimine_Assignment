<Abstract>
[Object] It is an object of the invention to provide a magnetic detection device and an electronic apparatus, each enabling bipolar detection to be performed with a circuit arrangement simpler than in the related art. [Solving Means] A magnetic detection device 30 of an embodiment of the present invention includes a first magnetoresistive effect element 12 based on the magnetoresistive effect that an electrical resistance of the element varies in response to an external magnetic field, and a common circuit unit connected to the magnetoresistive effect element 12 and enabled to detect both an external magnetic field in a (+) direction and an external magnetic field in a (-) direction opposite to the (+) direction in response to a change in the electrical resistance. Since the use of the common circuit unit suffices in the embodiment, a magnetic detection device enabled to perform bipolar detection with a circuit arrangement simpler than in the related art results. The magnetic detection device is also miniaturized.
