<Abstract>
Embodiments of a method of quantum well intermixing (QWI) comprise providing a wafer comprising upper and lower epitaxial layers, which each include barrier layers, and a quantum well layer disposed between the upper and lower epitaxial layers, applying at least one sacrificial layer over the upper epitaxial layer, and forming a QWI enhanced region and a QWI suppressed region by applying a QWI enhancing layer over a portion of the sacrificial layer, wherein the portion under the QWI enhancing layer is the QWI enhanced region, and the other portion is the QWI suppressed region.;  The method further comprises the steps of applying a QWI suppressing layer over the QWI enhanced region and the QWI suppressed region, and annealing at a temperature sufficient to cause interdiffusion of atoms between the quantum well layer and the barrier layers of the upper epitaxial layer and the lower epitaxial layer.
