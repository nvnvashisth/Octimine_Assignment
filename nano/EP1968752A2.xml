<Abstract>
Methods and articles providing for precise aligning, positioning, shaping, and linking of nanotubes and carbon nanotubes. An article comprising: a solid surface comprising at least two different surface regions including: a first surface region which comprises an outer boundary and which is adapted for carbon nanotube adsorption, and a second surface region which is adapted for preventing carbon nanotube adsorption, the second region forming an interface with the outer boundary of the first region, at least one carbon nanotube which is at least partially selectively adsorbed at the interface. The shape and size of the patterns on the surface and the length of the carbon nanotube can be controlled to provide for selective interfacial adsorption.
