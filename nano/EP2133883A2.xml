<Abstract>
An Atomic Force Microscopy probe configuration (6) is disclosed, comprising a cantilever (8), and a planar tip (19) attached to the cantilever (8), which only partially overlaps the planar tip (19), and extending along a longitudinal direction (x) thereof. The planar tip (19) is of a two-dimensional geometry having at least one corner (20) remote from the cantilever (8), which corner (20) during use contacts a surface (18) to be scanned.
