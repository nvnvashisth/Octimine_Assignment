<Abstract>
A composition of matter having multiple layers of different conductors separated by thin layers of dielectric materials has a high piezoelectric coefficient when the conductors are metals having a significant difference in work function and the dielectric materials have a low elastic modulus when the metal layers are connected to form a capacitive circuit. Alternatively, when the conductors are semi-conductors they should have a significant difference in Fermi levels.
