<Abstract>
A representative embodiment of the invention provides a projection system having a laser source that incorporates a tunable liquid lens and a spatial light modulator adapted to modulate light generated by the laser source to project an image on a viewing screen. The tunable liquid lens is adapted to vary focal length, alignment or position with respect to an optical element that is external to the lens, ability to diffuse light, and/or polarization rotation angle.
