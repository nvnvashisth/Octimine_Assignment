<Abstract>
An electron emission source is disclosed, in which the fine carbon fibers included are uniformly dispersed as compared with those in the conventionally known electron emission sources, and the manufacturing of which is also easy. The electron emission source is manufactured by preparing a carbon fibrous structures&apos; dispersion which comprises at least carbon fibrous structures and a binder resin, wherein carbon fibrous structure comprises a three dimensional network of carbon fibers, each of which having an outside diameter of 15 - 100 nm, wherein the carbon fibrous structure further comprises a granular part, at which two or more carbon fibers are bound in a state that the carbon fibers extend outwardly therefrom, and wherein the granular part is produced in a growth process of the carbon fibers;  applying the carbon fibrous structures&apos; dispersion onto the substrate; ;  and solidifying the applied carbon fibrous structures&apos; dispersion.
