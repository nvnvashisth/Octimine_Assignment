<Abstract>
A cantilever holder includes a glass substrate (130) on which a cantilever chip (110) is to be placed, a holding stage (140) to hold the glass substrate (130), a vibrator (138) fixed to the lower surface of the glass substrate (130), and a holding mechanism to position and hold the cantilever chip (110) at a position opposing the vibrator (138) through the glass substrate (130). The holding mechanism includes a press member (120) to press the cantilever chip (110) against the glass substrate (130). The press member (120) includes a notch (122) that tightly fits with the support (113).

<Claims>
<P>
1. A cantilever holder characterized by comprising:
</P>
<P>
a glass substrate (130) on which a cantilever chip (110) is to be placed;
</P>
<P>
a holding stage (140) to hold the glass substrate (130);
</P>
<P>
a vibrator (138) fixed to a lower surface of the glass substrate (130); and
</P>
<P>
a holding mechanism (120, 128, 144) to position and hold the cantilever chip (110) at a position opposing the vibrator (138) through the glass substrate (130), the holding mechanism (120, 128, 144) including a press member (120) to press the cantilever chip (110) against the glass substrate (130), and the press member (120) including a notch (122) that tightly fits with part of the cantilever chip (110).
</P>
<P>
2. A holder according to claim 1, characterized in that
</P>
<P>
the cantilever chip (110) includes a probe (111), a cantilever (112) supporting the probe (111) at an end thereof, and a support (113) supporting the cantilever (112), and
</P>
<P>
the glass substrate (130) includes a support surface (132) on which the cantilever chip (110) is to be placed, and an inclined surface (134) extending continuously from the support surface (132) and being inclined with respect to the support surface (132), the inclined surface (134) being located on a side of the support surface (132) where the cantilever (112) of the cantilever chip (110) positioned and held by the holding mechanism (120, 128, 144) extends from the support (113) and being inclined to a side where a distance from the probe (111) increases.
</P>
<P>
3. A scanning probe microscope holder characterized by comprising:
</P>
<P>
a glass substrate (130) on which a cantilever chip (110) is to be placed;
</P>
<P>
a holding stage (140) to hold the glass substrate (130);
</P>
<P>
a vibrator (138) fixed to a lower surface of the glass substrate (130);
</P>
<P>
a holding mechanism (120, 128, 144) to position and hold the cantilever chip (110) at a position opposing the vibrator (138) through the glass substrate (130), the holding mechanism (120, 128, 144) including a press member (120) to press the cantilever chip (110) against the glass substrate (130), and the press member (120) including a notch (122) that tightly fits with part of the cantilever chip (110);
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
a scanner (191) to scan the specimen stage (192);
</P>
<P>
an observation optical system (260) to observe the specimen including an objective lens (210), the objective lens (210) including a correction mechanism (212) to correct aberration caused by a thickness of the glass substrate (130) and by a liquid supplied onto the glass substrate (130); and
</P>
<P>
a position adjustment mechanism (150, 155, 160, 171, 172, 173, 174, 181, 183) to adjust a position of the holding stage (140) along an optical axis of the objective lens (210).
