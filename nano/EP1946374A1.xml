<Abstract>
To provide a semiconductor device which is higher functional and reliable and a technique capable of manufacturing the semiconductor device with a high yield at low cost without complexing the apparatus or process. At least one of a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer is formed containing one kind or plural kinds of indium, tin, lead, bismuth, calcium, manganese, or zinc;  or oxidation treatment is performed at least one of interfaces between an organic compound layer and the first conductive layer and between the organic compound layer and the second conductive layer. The first conductive layer, the organic compound layer, and the second conductive layer which are formed over a first substrate with a peeling layer interposed therebetween can be peeled from the first substrate with the peeling layer, and transposed to a second substrate.
