<Abstract>
The present invention provides a method for detecting a target analyte in a sample, using a pro-macromolecular structure switch which has an analyte binding site for binding the analyte to form together, a macromolecular switch, with an ion coordination site, and arms flippable between discretely different conformations corresponding to different ion binding conditions. The different conformations provide, with an output signal reading system, characteristic output signals. The pro-switch is contacted with sample and an external input signal applied to the input device to change ion binding conditions to flip switch conformations, and changes in output signal are read out. The invention also provides a pro-macromolecular structure switch.
