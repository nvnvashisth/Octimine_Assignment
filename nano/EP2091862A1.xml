<Abstract>
The present invention relates to light emitting diodes comprising at least one nanowire. The LED according to the invention is an upstanding nanostructure with the nanowire protruding from a substrate. A bulb with a larger diameter than the nanowire is arranged in connection to the nanowire and at an elevated position with regards to the substrate. A pn-junction is formed by the combination of the bulb and the nanowire resulting in an active region to produce light.
