<Abstract>
An optical platform including optical bench, an optical or photonic coupling device and a photonic circuit. The photonic circuit includes a photonic crystal along a waveguide and/or defect. The coupling device may be a waveguide or impedance matching interconnection device. The optical bench includes a rectangular trench to seat an optical fiber and provide alignment with the photonic circuit.
