<Abstract>
The invention suggests a transistor (21) comprising a source (24) and a drain (29) as well as a barrier region (27) located between the source and the drain. The barrier region is separated from the source and the drain by intrinsic or lowly doped regions (26, 28) of a semiconductor material. Potential barriers are formed at the interfaces of the barrier region and the intrinsic or lowly doped regions. A gate electrode (32) is provided in the vicinity of the potential barriers such that the effective height and/or width of the potential barriers can be modulated by applying an appropriate voltage to the gate electrode.
