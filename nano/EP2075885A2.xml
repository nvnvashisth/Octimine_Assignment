<Abstract>
The laser device has a gain medium (103), first and second clads (101,102) sandwiching the gain medium in the thickness direction, and a cavity structure for resonating the electromagnetic wave generated in the gain medium. The gain medium includes a plurality of active regions (140,160) for generating an electromagnetic wave and at lease one connecting region (150) sandwiched among the active regions. The first and second clads are each formed of a negative permittivity medium having a permittivity the real part of which is negative relative to the electromagnetic wave. A potential-adjusting portion is arranged between the connecting region and the first clad and between the connecting region and the second clad for adjusting the electric potential of the connecting region.
