<Abstract>
A method of using metallized and nonmetallized nanostructured chemicals as surface and volume modification agents within polymers and on the surfaces of nano and macroscopic particulates and fillers. Because of their 0.5 nm - 3.0 nm size, nanostructured chemicals can be utilized to greatly increase surface area, improve compatibility, and promote lubricity between surfaces at a length scale not previously attainable.

CLAIMS
</P>
<P>
1. A method for modifying the surface or interfacial properties of a material comprising the steps of: (a) providing a polymer or particulate material selected from the group consisting of (i) a polymer selected from the group consisting of acrylics, carbonates, epoxies, esters, silicones, polyolefins, polyethers, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyimides, phenolics, cyanate esters, polyureas, resoles, polyanalines, fluropolymers, silicones, styrenics, amides, nitriles, olefins, aromatic oxides, aromatic sulfides, esters, and ionomers or rubbery polymers derived from hydrocarbons and silicones, and (ii) a particulate selected from the group consisting of metals, metal alloys, oxides, ceramics, ceramic alloys, microtubes, nanotubes, inorganic compounds, organic compounds, man-made materials, and naturally occurring materials; and (b) incorporating a nanostructured cher[eta]ical selected from the group consisting of POSS, POS, and POMS with the material by mixing; wherein the surface roughness of the mixture is increased or decreased by at least twenty-five percent relative to the surface roughness of the unmixed material.
</P>
<P>
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the surface area of the material is modified by the nanostructured chemical.
</P>
<P>
3. The method of claim 1 , wherein the volume of the material is modified by the nanostructured chemical.
</P>
<P>
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the nanostructured chemical reinforces the material at a molecular level.
</P>
<P>
5. The method of claim 1 , wherein the nanostructured chemical is reactively blended into the mixture.
</P>
<P>
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein the nanostructured chemical is nonreactively blended into the mixture.
</P>
<P>
7. The method of claim 1 , wherein the material is a projectile or a sabot, and the surface roughness of the material is decreased.
</P>
<P>
8. The method of claim 1 , wherein a physical property selected from the group consisting of lubricity and friction is improved by incorporating the nanostructured chemical into the material.
</P>
<P>
9. A method for dispersing a particulate into a polymer, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a polymer selected from the group consisting of acrylics, carbonates, epoxies, esters, silicones, polyolefins, polyethers, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyimides, phenolics, cyanate esters, polyureas, resoles, polyanalines, fluropolymers, silicones, styrenics, amides, nitriles, olefins, aromatic oxides, aromatic sulfides, esters, and ionomers or rubbery polymers derived from hydrocarbons and silicones; (b) providing a particulate material selected from the group consisting of metals, metal alloys, oxides, ceramics, ceramic alloys, microtubes, nanotubes, inorganic compounds, organic compounds, man-made materials, and naturally occurring materials; and (c) incorporating a nanostructured chemical selected from the group consisting of POSS, POS, and POMS with the polymer and particulate by mixing; wherein the nanostructured material facilitates dispersion of the particulate in the polymer.
</P>
<P>
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the nanostructured chemical reinforces the polymer at a molecular level.
</P>
<P>
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the nanostructured chemical reactively bonds with the polymer or the particulate.
</P>
<P>
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the nanostructured chemical is nonreactively blended into the mixture.
