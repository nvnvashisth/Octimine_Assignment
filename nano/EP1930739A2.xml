<Abstract>
A magnetic detector includes a magnetoresistive element (10) and a fixed resistor (20) that are constituted from identical laminates. Hard bias layers (17,18) are disposed on two sides of the fixed resistor (20) each with a gap therebetween. The magnetoresistive element (10) includes a magnetic layer, magnetization direction of which is variable;  the fixed resistor (20) includes a magnetic layer corresponding to the magnetic layer of the magnetoresistive element (10);  and the magnetization direction of the magnetic layer of the fixed resistor is pinned by a bias magnetic field from the hard bias layers (17,18).
