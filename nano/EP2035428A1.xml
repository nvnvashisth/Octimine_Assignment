<Abstract>
The present invention relates to polymers comprising a repeating unit of the formula (l) and their use as organic semiconductor in organic devices, especially a diode, an organic field effect transistor and/or a solar cell, or a device containing a diode and/or an organic field effect transistor, and/or a solar cell. The polymers according to the invention have excellent solubility in organic solvents and excellent film-forming properties. In addition, high efficiency of energy conversion, excellent field-effect mobility, good on/off current ratios and/or excellent stability can be observed, when the polymers according to the invention are used in semiconductor devices or organic photovoltaic (PV) devices (solar cells).
