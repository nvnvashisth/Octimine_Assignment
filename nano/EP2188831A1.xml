<Abstract>
A multi-layer stack for imprint lithography is formed by applying a first polymerizable composition to a substrate, polymerizing the first polymerizable composition to form a first polymerized layer, applying a second polymerizable composition to the first polymerized layer, and polymerizing the second polymerizable composition to form a second polymerized layer on the first polymerized layer. The first polymerizable composition includes a polymerizable component with a glass transition temperature less than about 25 DEG  C., and the first polymerized layer is substantially impermeable to the second polymerizable composition.
