<Abstract>
A field effect transistor includes a thin layer of discontinuous conductive clusters between the gate dielectric and the active layer. The active layer can include an organic semiconductor or a blend of organic semiconductor and polymer. Metals, metal oxides, predominantly non-carbon metallic materials, and/or carbon nanotubes may be used to form the layer of conductive clusters. The conductive clusters improve transistor performance and also facilitate transistor fabrication.
