<Abstract>
Magnetic particles for nucleic acid isolation are coated with silica and separated from impurities and nanoparticulates using a multi-step fractionation process. In each cycle of the fractionation process, the particles are stirred, sedimented, and resuspended, resulting in a decline in pH of the suspended particles. Repeating the fractionation process until the resuspended particles have dropped to a target pH in the range of about 9 to 10.5, and their zeta potential is more negative than about -40 mV, results in a purified population of particles with a high and reproducible binding capacity for nucleic acids. The silica-treated magnetic beads produced by the method offer improved sensitivity and consistency for recovery of nucleic acids in a sample.
