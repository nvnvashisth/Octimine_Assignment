<Abstract>
A method for fabricating AlxGa1-xN-cladding-free nonpolar III-nitride based laser diodes or light emitting diodes. Due to the absence of polarization fields in the nonpolar crystal planes, these nonpolar devices have thick quantum wells that function as an optical waveguide to effectively confine the optical mode to the active region and eliminate the need for Al-containing waveguide cladding layers.
