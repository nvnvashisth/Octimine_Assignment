<Abstract>
The present invention is directed towards a method and a system to create and maintain a desired environment in the vicinity of a nano-imprint lithography template by creation of a partial vacuum using channels or holes in the template holding the nano-imprint mold.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
Claims
</P>
<P>
1. A system for creating a specific environment between a template and a substrate during a nanolithography imprinting process, comprising: a substrate; a template positioned in close proximity to the substrate creating a volume of space between a nano-imprint mold on the template and a corresponding location on the substrate; and a means for creating a partial evacuation of gas in the volume of space between the nano- imprint mold and the substrate.
</P>
<P>
2. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the template further comprises a plurality of holes positioned around the nano-imprint mold and passing through the template, the creating means utilizing the plurality of holes to create the partial evacuation of gas in the volume of space between the nano-imprint mold and the substrate.
</P>
<P>
3. The system as recited in claim 1 , wherein the template further comprises a channel formed in the template around the nano-imprint mold, the channel coupled to the creating means.
</P>
<P>
4. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the creating means further comprises a body positioned around the template in a configuration that creates a gap between sides of the template and sides of the body whereby air flow up through the gap evacuates gas from between the template and the substrate.
</P>
<P>
5. The system as recited in claim 1, further comprising a polymerizable fluid dispensed between the nano-imprint mold and the substrate.
</P>
