<Abstract>
Methods of forming nanostructures with chromonic materials are disclosed. A method includes coating a substrate surface with a chromonic solution to form a chromonic layer, removing at least a portion of the water to form a dried chromonic layer, and exposing the dried chromonic layer to an organic solvent to form a pattern of channels within the dried chromonic layer. The chromonic solution includes a chromonic material and water. Materials can be deposited within the channels to form a pattern of nanostructures.
