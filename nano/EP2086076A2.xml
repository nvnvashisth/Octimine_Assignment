<Abstract>
A nitride semiconductor laser element having a first nitride semiconductor layer (11), an active layer (12), a second nitride semiconductor layer (13), a first protective film (25) in contact with a cavity end face of the nitride semiconductor laser, and a second protective film (26) formed on the first protective film (25), wherein the second protective film (26) has a thick part protruding from a face on the cavity end face side and from a face opposite the cavity end face.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
