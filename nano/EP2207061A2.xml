<Abstract>
A system to vary dimensions of a template comprising a frame (192) having a central aperture (194), and an actuator sub-assembly (190) including a plurality of lever sub-assemblies (196) mounted to the frame (192);  the actuator sub assemblies are operable to apply a force such as to provide aperture (194) with appropriate dimensions to receive template (26).
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
1. A system to vary dimensions of a template, said system comprising:
</P>
<P>
a frame (192) having a central aperture (194);
</P>
<P>
an actuator sub-assembly (190) including a plurality of lever sub-assemblies (196) mounted to the frame (192) to direct compressive forces along a neutral axis of template (26), each of lever sub-assemblies (196) including:
</P>
<P>
a body (198) having a contact surface (220) spaced-apart a distance from the contact surface (220) of an opposing body (198) associated with one of the remaining lever sub-assemblies of said plurality of lever sub-assemblies;
</P>
<P>
a lever arm (200) having first and second opposed termini (208, 210);
</P>
<P>
a linkage system (204), coupled between said body and said lever arm, and designed to:
</P>
<P>
translate angular motion of said lever arm (200) about an axis into movement of said body (198) in a direction to vary said distance, and
</P>
<P>
allow angular movement between said body (198) and said lever arm (200);and
</P>
<P>
an actuation system (202) to impart said angular movement;
</P>
<P>
the actuator sub assembly being operable to apply a force to terminus region (208) to provide aperture (194) with appropriate dimensions to receive template (26), wherein actuator sub-assembly (190) is designed such that without said force being applied, aperture (194) has dimensions that are smaller than the dimensions of template (26).
</P>
<P>
2. The system of claim 1, wherein actuator sub-assembly (190) is operable to pull against first terminus region (208) and cause retraction of body (198) away from an opposing body (198) to increase the size of aperture (194) for loading of template (26).
</P>
<P>
3. The system of claim 1 or 2 comprising a chucking system (40) holding template (26) within aperture (194), body (198) being allowed to press against template (26) without force being generated by actuation system (202).
</P>
<P>
4. The system of claim 2 o 3, wherein the second terminus region (210) of lever arm (200) is coupled to linkage system (204) to impart a force thereon.
</P>
<P>
5. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein each body (198) of lever sub-assemblies (196) extends from linkage system (204) away from lever arm (200) toward aperture (194) and terminates in superimposition therewith.
</P>
<P>
6. The system of the preceding claim, wherein the plurality of lever sub-assemblies (196) are coupled to frame (192) so that the plurality of bodies (198) associated therewith are symmetrically disposed with respect to aperture (194).
</P>
<P>
7. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein that each of the plurality of bodies (198) is disposed opposite one of the remaining bodies (198) of the plurality of bodies (198), an equal number of bodies (198) being present on opposing sides of aperture (194).
</P>
<P>
8. The system of any one of the preceding claims 3 to 7, wherein the template carries a mold (28) and wherein the entire actuator sub-assembly (190) is positioned to lie on one side of mold (28) so as to be spaced-apart from a plane in which a mold surface (39) lies.
</P>
<P>
9. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein contact surface (220) in body (198) is configured to extend parallel to and make contact with a side (218) of template (26).
</P>
<P>
10. The system of the preceding claim, wherein the actuation system (202) comprises a piston (206) coupled to first terminus region (208) of lever arm (200) through a flex joint (212) and designed to push or pull against the first terminus region (208), and wherein
</P>
<P>
the actuation system (202) is coupled to a pump system (180) to cause actuation system (202) to impart angular movement of lever arm (200), said piston (206) imparting a force upon one end of lever arm (200) through flexure joint (212) to cause lever arm (200) to undergo rotational movement that causes body (198) to undergo translational movement toward template (26), thereby decreasing the area defined by the plurality of bodies (198).
</P>
<P>
11. The system as recited in claim 1 wherein said linkage system (204) is coupled between said lever arm (200) and said body (198) to facilitate angular movement of said body with respect to said lever arm about an additional axis extending parallel to said axis.
</P>
<P>
12. The system as recited in claim 1 wherein said linkage system (204) is coupled between said lever arm (200) and said body (198) to facilitate angular movement of said body with respect to said lever arm about an additional axis extending orthogonally to said axis.
</P>
<P>
13. The system as recited in claim 1 wherein said linkage system (204) is coupled between said lever arm (200) and said body (198) to facilitate angular movement of said body with respect to said lever arm about two additional axes one of which extends orthogonally to said axis, with the remaining axis of said two additional axes extending parallel to said axis.
</P>
<P>
14. A method to vary dimensions of a template using the system of any one of claims 1 to 13 comprising the steps of:
</P>
<P>
operating actuator sub-assembly (190) to pull against terminus region (208) and cause retraction of body (198) away from an opposing body (198) to increase the size of aperture (194) for loading of template (26);
</P>
<P>
disposing template (26) within aperture (194);
</P>
<P>
allowing bodies (198) to press against template (26) without force being generated by actuation system (202).
</P>
<P>
15. The method of the preceding claim, wherein the actuation system (202) comprises a piston (206) coupled to first terminus region (208) of lever arm (200) through a flex joint (212) and designed to push or pull against the first terminus region (208) to impart angular movement of lever arm (200).
