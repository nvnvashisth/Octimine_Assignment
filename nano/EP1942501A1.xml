<Abstract>
The invention concerns a recording apparatus for reproducing information recorded on a recording medium by utilising near-field light. The recording apparatus comprises: an aperture element having two microscopic apertures to scatter near-field light;  a light illuminating means for introducing illumination light to the recording medium such that near-field light is created on a surface of the recording medium;  a first light detecting means for detecting first propagation light caused by one of the microscopic apertures scattering the near-field light and for converting the detected first propagation light into a reproduced signal the reproduced signal representative of recorded information;  a second light detecting means for detecting second propagation light caused by the other of the microscopic apertures scattering the near-field light, and for converting the detected second propagation light into a control signal, the control signal for use in controlling the spacing between the aperture element and the recording medium;  and a control means for controlling a spacing between the aperture element and the recording medium based on the control signal.
