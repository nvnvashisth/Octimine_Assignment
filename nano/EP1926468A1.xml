<Abstract>
A dispersion contains particles of metal oxide having a median volume particle diameter in the range from 24 to 42 nm which are dispersed in a medium which includes a mixture of at least one polar material having an interfacial tension of less than 30 mNm&amp;lt;-1&amp;gt; and at least one siloxane fluid. The dispersion can be used in a sunscreen product that exhibits effective UV protection, transparency, and improved skin feel.
