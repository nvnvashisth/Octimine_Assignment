<Abstract>
A sample atomic configuration creation means (211) in a control section (21) creates the atomic arrangement data of a sample, and a sample surface height calculation means (212) calculates a sample surface height for every mesh. A probe profile creation means (213) creates the atomic arrangement data of a probe, and a probe surface height calculation means (214) calculates the height of the probe surface for every mesh. A probe scanning means (216) supplies the coordinate of a scanning start position in the scanning range to a collision height specification means (215). The collision height specification means (215) calculates the distance between the sample surface and the probe in each mesh. Calculation of this distance is repeated for all meshes of the probe at the coordinate of this measuring position.
