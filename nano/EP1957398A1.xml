<Abstract>
Disclosed herein are core-shell type nanoparticles comprising nanoparticle cores made of a metal or semiconductor, and shells made of crystalline metal oxide formed on the surfaces of the nanoparticle cores, as well as a preparation method thereof. According to the disclosed invention, the core-shell nanoparticles, consisting of metallic or semiconductor cores and crystalline metal oxide shells, can be prepared by epitaxially growing metal oxide on the surfaces of the metallic or semiconductor nanoparticle cores. By virtue of the crystalline metal oxide shells, the core nanoparticle made of metal or semiconductor can ensure excellent chemical and mechanical stability, and the core-shell nanoparticles can show new properties resulting from the interaction between the metal cores and the metal oxide crystal shells.
