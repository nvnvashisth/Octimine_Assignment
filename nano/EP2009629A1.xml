<Abstract>
A first thermal buffer layer (23) and a second thermal buffer layer (24) are arranged between a recording medium (21) and an actuator structure (22). The heat conductivity of the first thermal buffer layer (23) is set low and the heat conductivity of the second thermal buffer layer (24) is set high. Most of the heat generated from a coil wiring (23) of the actuator structure (22) is blocked by the first thermal buffer layer (23), and heat leaked from the first thermal buffer layer (23) is diffused by the second thermal buffer layer (24). Temperature distribution on the recording medium (21) is made uniform, and thus, a configuration wherein the recording medium (21) and the actuator structure (22) are placed one over another can be provided, information reading accuracy or information recording stability can be improved and the sizes of an information storage device can be reduced.
