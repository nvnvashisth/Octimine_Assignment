<Abstract>
A nonpolar III -nitride film grown on a miscut angle of a substrate. The miscut angle towards the &amp;lt;000-l&amp;gt; direction is 0.75 DEG  or greater miscut and less than 27 DEG  miscut towards the &amp;lt;000-l&amp;gt; direction. Surface undulations are suppressed and may comprise faceted pyramids. A device fabricated using the film is also disclosed. A nonpolar Ill-nitride film having a smooth surface morphology fabricated using a method comprising selecting a miscut angle of a substrate upon which the nonpolar III -nitride films are grown in order to suppress surface undulations of the nonpolar Ill-nitride films. A nonpolar Ill-nitride-based device grown on a film having a smooth surface morphology grown on a miscut angle of a substrate which the nonpolar Ill-nitride films are grown. The miscut angle may also be selected to achieve long wavelength light emission from the nonpolar film.
