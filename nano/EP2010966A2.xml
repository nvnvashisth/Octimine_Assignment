<Abstract>
In an alignment method for effecting alignment between two plate-like objects, a first plate-like object provided with a first alignment mark and a second plate-like object provide with a second alignment mark are disposed opposite to each other. A first area and a second area are provided at mutually nonoverlapping positions in an image pickup area for being observed through an image pickup &amp;gt; device. Images of the first and second alignment marks are picked up by the image pickup device from a direction substantially perpendicular to an in-plane direction of the first and second plate-like objects. Alignment control is effected by using first information about a deviation of the first alignment mark from a predetermined position in the first area and second information about a deviation of the second alignment mark from a predetermined position in the second area.
