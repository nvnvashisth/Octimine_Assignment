<Abstract>
A coating containing pigment particles and a polymer matrix is provided. The coating contains pigment particles that have a scattering coefficient with a linear or quasi-linear relationship to the pigment volume concentration of those pigment particles. The coating has improved hiding and is useful as a protective coating or an aesthetic coating on an underlying substrate. Also provided are compositions useful for preparing the coating, including covalently bonded composite particles and aqueous dispersions containing composite particles. The composite particles each contain a pigment particle with a plurality of polymer particles attached by adsorption on the outer surface of the pigment particle or by covalent bonding to the pigment particle through a coupling agent. Methods to prepare the composite particles and coating compositions containing the composite particles are also provided.

</P>
<P>
b) forming a modified pigment particle by reacting or allowing to react said pigment particle and at least a portion of said first functional groups of said second plurality of molecules of said coupling agent, such that said modified pigment particle has a third plurality of molecules of said coupling agent with reacted first functional groups, covalently bonded thereto;
</P>
<P>
c) admixing said modified pigment particle and said first plurality of polymer particles, each of said first plurality of polymer particles comprising said complementary functional group; and
</P>
<P>
d) forming said composite particle by reacting or allowing to react said second functional group of said third plurality of molecules of said coupling agent and said complementary functional group of said first plurality of polymer particles, forming a covalent bond there between, such that at least one of said first plurality of said polymer particles is covalently bonded to one of said third plurality of molecules of said coupling agent.
