<Abstract>
The invention concerns a recording apparatus for reproducing information recorded on a recording medium by utilising near-field light. The recording apparatus comprises: an aperture element having a microscopic aperture to scatter near-field light;  a light illuminating means for introducing illumination light to the recording medium such that near-field light is created on a surface of the recording medium, the illumination light comprising two different modulation frequencies;  a first light detecting means for detecting first propagation light caused by the microscopic aperture scattering the near-field light having one of the two modulation frequencies, and for converting the detected first propagation light into a reproduced signal;  a second light detecting means for detecting second propagation light caused by the microscopic aperture scattering the near-field light having the other of the two modulation frequencies, and for converting the detected second propagation light into a control signal;  and a control means for controlling a spacing between the aperture element and the recording medium based on the control signal.

<Claims>
<P>
1. A recording apparatus for reproducing information recorded on a recording medium (10) by utilising near-field light, the recording apparatus, comprising:
</P>
<P>
an aperture element (11) having a microscopic aperture (12) to scatter near-field light;
</P>
<P>
a light illuminating means (53, 54) for introducing illumination light (40) to the recording medium (10) such that near-field light is created on a surface of the recording medium (10), the illumination light (40) comprising two different modulation frequencies (fl, f2);
</P>
<P>
a first light detecting means (17) for detecting first propagation light caused by the microscopic aperture (12) scattering the near-field light having one of the two modulation frequencies (fl, f2), and for converting the detected first propagation light into a reproduced signal;
</P>
<P>
a second light detecting means (17) for detecting second propagation light caused by the microscopic aperture (12) scattering the near-field light having the other of the two modulation frequencies (f1, f2), and for converting the detected second propagation light into a control signal; and
</P>
<P>
a control means (59) for controlling a spacing between the aperture element (11) and the recording medium (10) based on the control signal.
</P>
<P>
2. A recording apparatus for reproducing information recorded on a recording medium (10) or recording information on the recording medium (10) by utilising near-field light, the recording apparatus, comprising:
</P>
<P>
an aperture element (11) having a microscopic aperture (12) to create near-field light;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
a second light detecting means (17) for detecting second propagation light caused by the recording medium (10) scattering the near-field light having the other of the two modulation frequencies (fl, f2), and for converting the detected second propagation light into a control signal; and
</P>
<P>
a control means (59) for controlling a spacing between the aperture element (11) and the recording medium (10) based on the control signal.
</P>
<P>
3. A recording apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising:
</P>
<P>
a horizontal fine vibrating means (165, 171) for causing the aperture element (161) to finely vibrate in a direction perpendicular to a direction of arrangement of information units recorded on the recording medium (10) and a direction parallel with a surface of the recording medium (10); and
</P>
<P>
a position control means (19) for controlling a position of the aperture element (161) such that the reproduced signal becomes a maximum in a vibration centre of fine vibration due to horizontal fine vibrating means (165, 171).
