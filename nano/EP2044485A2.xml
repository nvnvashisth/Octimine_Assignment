<Abstract>
Lithographic and nanolithographic methods that involve patterning a first compound on a substrate surface, exposing non-patterned areas of the substrate surface to a second compound and removing the first compound while leaving the second compound intact. The resulting hole patterns can be used as templates for either chemical etching of the patterned area of the substrate or metal deposition on the patterned area of the substrate.
