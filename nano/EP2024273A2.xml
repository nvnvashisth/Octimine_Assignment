<Abstract>
A method of making ordered nanostructured layers comprises (a) applying an aqueous composition comprising a chromonic material to the surface of a substrate, (b) applying shear orientation to the aqueous composition, (c) non-covalently crosslinking the resulting ordered nanostructured chromonic layer with a multivalent cation salt (d) exposing the resulting crosslinked ordered nanostructured chromonic layer to an acid selected from the group consisting of carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, boric acid, sulfuric acid, and mixtures thereof in the presence of water to form an ordered nanostructured barrier layer.

</P>
<P>
(a) applying an aqueous composition comprising a chromonic material to the surface of a substrate;

</P>
<P>
(c) non-covalently crosslinking the resulting ordered nanostructured chromonic layer with a multivalent cation salt; and
</P>
<P>
(d) exposing the resulting crosslinked ordered nanostructured chromonic layer to an acid selected from the group consisting of carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, boric acid, sulfuric acid, and mixtures thereof in the presence of water to form an ordered nanostructured barrier layer comprising a complex comprising the chromonic material, the multivalent cations, and the acid anions on the ordered nanostructured chromonic layer; wherein the acid is present in an amount that does not substantially dissolve the crosslinked ordered nanostructured chromonic layer.
