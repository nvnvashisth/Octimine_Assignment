<Abstract>
Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to crossbar array designs that interfaces wires to address wires, despite misalignments between electrical components and wires. In one embodiment, a nanoscale device may be composed of a first layer of two or more wires and a second layer of two or more address wires that overlays the first layer. The nanoscale device may also include an intermediate layer positioned between the first layer and the second layer. Two or more redundant electrical component patterns may be fabricated within the intermediate layer so that one or more of the electrical component patterns is aligned with the first and second layers.
