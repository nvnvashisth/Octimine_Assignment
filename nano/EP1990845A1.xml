<Abstract>
An ambipolar light-emitting transistor comprising an organic semiconductive zone between an electron injecting electrode and a hole injecting electrode, that is capable of emitting light from the semiconductive zone when operated in a biasing regime in which negative electrons are injected from an electron injecting electrode into the organic semiconductive zone and positive holes are injected from a hole injecting electrode into the organic semiconductive zone.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
1. An ambipolar light-emitting transistor comprising an organic semiconductive zone between an electron injecting electrode and a hole injecting electrode, that is capable of emitting light from the semiconductive zone when operated in a biasing regime in which negative electrons are injected from an electron injecting electrode into the organic semiconductive zone and positive holes are injected from a hole injecting electrode into the organic semiconductive zone.
</P>
<P>
2. An ambipolar light-emitting transistor according to claim 1, wherein the electron injecting electrode and the hole injecting electrode are separated by a distance L defining the channel length of the transistor, in which the organic semiconductive zone from which the light is emitted is located more than L/10 away from both the electron injecting electrode and the hole injecting electrode.
</P>
<P>
3. An ambipolar light-emitting transistor according to claim 1, wherein the organic semiconductive zone from which the light is emitted is located more than 1 m away from both the electron as well as the hole injecting electrode.
</P>
<P>
4. An ambipolar light-emitting transistor according to claim 1, wherein the organic semiconductive zone from which the light is emitted is located more than 5 m away from both the electron as well as the hole injecting electrode.
</P>
<P>
5. A method for biasing an ambipolar light-emitting transistor as defined in any preceding claim, wherein the bias voltage applied to a control gate electrode of the transistor is selected to be in between the bias voltage applied to the hole injecting electrode and that applied to the electron injecting electrode.
</P>
<P>
6. A method for operating a light-emitting transistor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the bias voltage applied to a control gate electrode, the bias voltage applied to the hole injecting electrode, and the electron injecting electrode are adjusted to move the recombination zone to a desired position along the channel of the transistor.
</P>
<P>
7. A method for making a light-emitting transistor as defined in any one of claims 1 to 4.
