<Abstract>
A driving apparatus (1) is provided with: a fixed part (11) having a fixed-part plane (12);  and a driven part (13) having a driven-part plane (14), which faces the fixed-part plane, and driven in a direction substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane, a liquid lubricant (30) is between the fixed-portion plane and the driven-part plane, the driven-part plane faces the fixed-part plane such that the driven-part plane is substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane.
</Abstract>
<Claims>
<P>
1. A driving apparatus comprising:
</P>
<P>
a fixed part having a fixed-part plane; and
</P>
<P>
a driven part having a driven-part plane, which faces the fixed-part plane, and driven in a direction substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane,
</P>
<P>
a liquid lubricant being between the fixed-portion plane and the driven-part plane,
</P>
<P>
the driven-part plane facing the fixed-part plane such that the driven-part plane is substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
2. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein there is a balance among (i) a surface tension that driven-part plane receives in a direction of crossing the driven-part plane from the lubricant, (ii) a repulsion that the driven-part plane receives in a direction of crossing the driven-part plane from the lubricant, and (iii) a force that the driven-part plane receives in the direction of crossing the driven-part plane from an element other than the lubricant.
</P>
<P>
3. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driven-part plane forms a depression with respect to a surface of said driven part in a surrounding of the driven-part plane.
</P>
<P>
4. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driven-part plane forms a projection with respect to a surface of said driven part in a surrounding of the driven-part plane.
</P>
<P>
5. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the fixed-part plane forms a depression with respect to a surface of said fixed part in a surrounding of the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
6. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the fixed-part plane forms a projection with respect to a surface of said fixed part in a surrounding of the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
7. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
</P>
<P>
the driven-part plane forms a depression with respect to a surface of said driven part in a surrounding of the driven-part plane, and
</P>
<P>
the fixed-part plane forms a projection, which corresponds to the depression, with respect to a surface of said fixed part in a surrounding of the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
8. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
</P>
<P>
the driven-part plane forms a projection with respect to a surface of said driven part in a surrounding of the driven-part plane, and
</P>
<P>
the fixed-part plane forms a depression, which corresponds to the projection, with respect to a surface of said fixed part in a surrounding of the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
9. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a driving mechanism for driving said fixed part in a substantially orthogonal direction to the fixed-part plane.
</P>
<P>
10. The driving apparatus according to claim 1, wherein each of said fixed part and said driven part is formed of a same substrate.
</P>
<P>
11. A recording / reproducing apparatus comprising:
</P>
<P>
a fixed part having a fixed-part plane; and
</P>
<P>
a driven part having a driven-part plane, which faces the fixed-part plane, and driven in a direction substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane,
</P>
<P>
a liquid lubricant being between the fixed-portion plane and the driven-part plane,
</P>
<P>
the driven-part plane facing the fixed-part plane such that the driven-part plane is substantially parallel to the fixed-part plane,
</P>
<P>
said driven part being equipped with a recording medium,
</P>
<P>
said fixed part being equipped with one or a plurality of recording / reproducing devices.
</P>
