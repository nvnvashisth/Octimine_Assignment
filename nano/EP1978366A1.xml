<Abstract>
A fluorescent label for a biomaterial which comprises an inorganic fluorescent nanoparticle characterized by having a modifying group bonded to the surface of the inorganic fluorescent nanoparticle, the modifying group having a site specifically binding to a biomaterial, the site specifically binding to a biomaterial containing at least one member selected from among a base constituting a DNA or an RNA, a nucleotide, a polynucleotide and an intercalator, and the site being located at the farthermost position from the surface of the inorganic fluorescent nanoparticle. Use of this fluorescent label makes it possible to conduct an analysis at an elevated sensitivity and an elevated accuracy in, for example, analyzing a biomaterial such as detecting a DNA or an RNA by the hybridization method or determining the base sequence of a DNA, detecting an antigen by the ELISA method and so on.
