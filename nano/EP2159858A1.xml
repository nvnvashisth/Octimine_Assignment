<Abstract>
The present invention provides a tunnel magnetoresistive thin film having a high MR ratio by improving heat resistance while maintaining a thin film of a Ru layer used as a non-magnetic layer so that the Ru layer expresses preferable exchange coupling magnetic field even through annealing at high temperature. In the tunnel magnetoresistive thin film, at least one of a first pinned magnetic layer and a second pinned magnetic layer that are layered having the non-magnetic layer for exchange coupling therebetween has a layered structure of two or more layers made of magnetic materials different from each other.
