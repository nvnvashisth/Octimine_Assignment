<Abstract>
A multispectral imaging array system and method of forming the same. A substrate and a group of antennas can be located with respect to one another on the substrate, such that respective gaps are formed between each antenna group and wherein different antenna sizes may be used for different spectral ranges. Additionally, one or more nanowires can be located within one or more gaps among the respective gaps, such that the nanowires in communication with the antennas and the substrate comprise a multispectral imaging system in which the use of the nanowire(s) decreases the thermal time constant and therefore the read out rate from the antennas while decreasing the ambient gas cooling speed relative to the read out rate to increase the manufacturability of the multispectral imaging array system.
