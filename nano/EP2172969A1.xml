The memory is configured to include: a storage element 3 which has a storage layer 17 that holds information according to a magnetization state of a magnetic substance and in which a magnetization fixed layer 31 is provided on the storage layer 17 with an intermediate layer 16 interposed therebetween, the intermediate layer 16 is formed of an insulator, the direction of magnetization M1 of the storage layer 17 is changed by injecting electrons spin-polarized in a lamination direction such that the information is recorded in the storage layer 17, and distortion is applied to the storage layer 17 from an insulating layer which exists around the storage layer 17 and has a smaller coefficient of thermal expansion than the storage layer 17;  and a wiring line for supplying a current flowing in the lamination direction of the storage element 3. Description of Reference Numerals and Signs 3: STORAGE ELEMENT 4, 21: CONTACT LAYER 11: BASE LAYER 12: ANTIFERROMAGNETIC LAYER 13, 15: FERROMAGNETIC LAYER 14: NON-MAGNETIC LAYER 16: TUNNEL INSULATING LAYER 17: STORAGE LAYER 18: CAP LAYER 22, 23, 25, 42, 44: INSULATING LAYER 24: BIT LINE 31: MAGNETIZATION FIXED LAYER 41: INSULATING LAYER (WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION) 43: LINER LAYER 45: ELEMENT SEPARATION LAYER
