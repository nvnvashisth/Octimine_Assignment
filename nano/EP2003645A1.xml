<Abstract>
Abstract: In a two-dimensional probe array, an interval between the leading ends of probes adjacent to each other in an X direction is made shorter than that between the leading ends of probes adjacent to each other in a Y direction. Thus, the leading ends of the probes are arranged to form a lattice (19) wherein many rectangles are arranged. Furthermore, the lowest resonance frequency of an actuator (21) which moves a recording medium (13) in the X direction is set higher than the lowest resonance frequency of an actuator (24) which moves the recording medium (13) in the Y direction. At the time of recording or reading information, the recording medium (13) is reciprocated in the X direction at a frequency substantially equal to the lowest resonance frequency of the actuator (21).
