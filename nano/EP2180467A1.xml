<Abstract>
The invention relates to a photon-mode recording method which comprises at least a first step of forming a latent image through irradiation with light and a second step of amplifying the latent image to form a refractivity difference or an absorbance difference and in which these steps are effected in a dry mode, and to a photon-mode recording material for the recording method.

</P>
<P>
5. The photon-mode recording method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the wavelength of the light for latent image formation in the first step is the same as the wavelength of the light for amplifying the latent image to form the refractivity difference or the absorbance difference in the second step, or the wavelength of the light in the second step is shorter than that in the first step.
</P>
<P>
6. An optical recording and reproducing method using a photon-mode recording material recorded according to the method of claim 1, which comprises: irradiating the recorded material with light; and detecting the reflectance difference based on the refractivity difference or the absorbance difference to perform a reproduction.
