<Abstract>
A scanning probe microscope is provided, which can be stably used for a long time even if excitation efficiency varies during scan. A cantilever (5) is excited, and the cantilever (5) and a sample are subjected to relative scanning. A second-harmonic component detection circuit (31) detects second-harmonic component amplitude of oscillation of the cantilever (5) as integral-multiple component amplitude. The second-harmonic component amplitude is amplitude of a second-harmonic component having a frequency twice as high as excitation frequency. An excitation intensity adjustment circuit (33) controls excitation intensity based on the detected second-harmonic component amplitude such that the second-harmonic component amplitude is kept constant.
