<Abstract>
A tamper detecting enclosure arrangement for enclosures containing an interior space in which a protected item is positioned having a magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell positioned in or near the protected item in the enclosure having a two state offset magnetoresistance versus externally applied magnetic field. A magnet is positioned at a selected separation distance from the magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell to thereby provide a magnetic field about the magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell if said enclosure has not been opened in such a maneer as to result in substantially increasing said separation distance.

<P>
CLAIMS:
</P>
<P>
1. A tamper detecting enclosure arrangement for enclosures containing an interior space in which a protected item is positioned to which access is to be denied absent providing a subsequent indication that such an access has occurred, said arrangement comprising: a magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell positioned in or near said protected item in said enclosure having a magnetoresistance versus externally applied magnetic field characteristic with two states of differing resistive values each reached from that other by an externally applied magnetic field having a magnitude change exceeding a corresponding one of a pair of relatively small transition field value intervals each having externally applied magnetic field values occurring therein of a common field direction but with those externally applied magnetic field values occurring therein differing in magnitudes from those in that other transition field value interval, and a magnet positioned at a selected separation distance from said magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell to thereby provide a magnetic field about said magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell if said enclosure has not been opened so as to result in substantially increasing said separation distance.
</P>
<P>
2. The arrangement of claim 1 wherein said enclosure has a receptacle with at least part of said interior space therein and a cover which can be positioned so as to render said interior space surrounded by said enclosure, said magnet being positioned in said cover.
</P>
<P>
3. The arrangement of claim 1 wherein said magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell is formed in a monolithic integrated circuit positioned in said interior space.
</P>
<P>
4. The arrangement of claim 1 further comprising a portion of a layer of magnetically permeable material positioned adjacent said magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell.
</P>
<P>
5. The arrangement of claim 1 further comprising another magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell positioned in or near said protected item in said enclosure having a magnetoresistance versus externally applied magnetic field characteristic with two states of differing resistive values each reached from that other by an externally applied magnetic field having a magnitude change exceeding a corresponding one of a pair of relatively small transition field value intervals each having externally applied magnetic field values occurring therein of a common field direction but with those externally applied magnetic field values occurring therein differing in magnitudes from those in that other transition field value interval.
</P>
<P>
6. The arrangement of claim 1 wherein said magnetoresistive sensing memory storage cell has a length along a selected direction and a width substantially perpendicular thereto that is smaller in extent than said length and together have a shaped end portion extending over a portion of said length in which said width gradually reduces to zero at that end thereof.
</P>
