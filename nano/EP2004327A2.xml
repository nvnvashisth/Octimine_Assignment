<Abstract>
A process for making high metal content stabilised metal nanoparticles, comprises reacting at least one metal acetylide with at least one amine or amine salt in the presence of a first solvent under reducing conditions to yield a metal colloid solution and then recovering metal nanoparticles as a precipitate by either evaporating the first solvent or adding a second solvent to the first solvent. The metal colloid solution obtainable as an intermediate by such a process and the high metal content stabilised metal nanoparticles obtainable as the final product of such a process are also disclosed. A process for making gold phenylacetylides, suitable for use as the at least one metal acetylide in the above process, is also disclosed.;  The process comprises reacting an aqueous solution of at least one gold salt with at least reducing agent in the presence of water to form a gold intermediate and then reacting the intermediate with a phenylacetylene in the presence of at least one alcohol and a de-protonating agent.
